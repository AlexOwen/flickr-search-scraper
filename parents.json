I had just left Aberdeen and moved here at the end of June '93. This was during my parents' first visit to Bellingham. You're looking at me exactly 15 years ago.\n\nFairhaven has changed a lot. Eclipse Books has a fancy new (few years old) building of their own, and I can't even recall what's in this old building now. Village Books has also moved into a new addition, leaving their old space to other businesses. The green behind Village Books has developed into a park with benches, shelters, and an outdoor projection screen for summer movies.\n\nThat's not so bad.\n\nA few blocks away, several brand new buildings have spring up. They tried to make them look &quot;appropriate&quot; for Fairhaven's quirky, artistic nature and for the &quot;Victorian Old West&quot; look of the old buildings. But the new buildings still are so shiny, so modern, so... commercial. I have mixed feelings about Fairhaven's growth.","rotation":0,"owner":"94336434@N00","ownerName":"Dave Ward Photography","height":"733","width":"1024","dateTaken":"1993-08-01 00:00:00","dateUpload":"744188400","dateCreate":"2004-10-18 01:06:14"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3138/2871524748_4bc49fe73c_o.jpg","title":"The best Halloween party ever ... not","license":"0","description":"After attending a Halloween party in 1992, I decided to throw one the following year.  After all, our hosts had made it look so easy!  Determined to create <i>the best Halloween party ever</i>, I borrowed about a gazillion idea books from the local library for Halloweenie fun, food and games. \n\nI worked my butt off to create a Haunted Trail back in the woods.  At my request, Tim sawed pieces of leftover plywood to create tombstones, which I spray-painted gray and stenciled with silly epitaphs, then added all sorts of goofy props – a rubber chicken nailed to a post is the only one I can remember now ... and I only remember it because I pounded my thumb with a sledgehammer white beating it into the ground.  But all my work was for naught – come party night, it was so bitterly cold that I had to <i>force</i> all the kids out there, and they hated it.\n\nOne party game called the <i>Mummy Roll</i> required groups wrapping up one team member in toilet paper.   A bunch of tissue even got wrapped around the fan in the den <i>(yep, the one that's two stories high)</i>.  I thought I'd never get it all out. \n\nSeveral parents attended with their kids.  I congratulated one of the moms on her witch outfit, and one of the dads on his biker costume ... then learned that neither of them were dressed up.   (She was goth, he was really a biker.)  It was several years before I was able to laugh about that embarrassing moment.\n\nMy biggest mistake<b>:</b>  Far too many guests were invited, ranging in age from 4 to 15.  Several uninvited guests showed up as well.  The whole event stressed me <i>way</i> out, and I ended up yelling at everyone.  What a disaster!\n\n<b><i>But there's good news:</i></b>\nBy the time this photo was taken, the party was over, the guests had fled, and the remaining kids were happy again.","rotation":0,"owner":"77502355@N00","ownerName":"carlacarlacarlacarla","height":"1981","width":"2639","dateTaken":"1993-10-30 00:00:00","dateUpload":"751957200"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1421/1283629801_d807efa769_o.jpg","title":"My parents' car...after","license":"0","description":"Sleep deprevation is a serious subject with me.","rotation":0,"owner":"11491542@N03","ownerName":"Tenorcub","height":"377","width":"600","dateTaken":"2007-08-31 02:50:09","dateUpload":"944090168","dateCreate":"2007-08-15 09:16:24"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1397/861448933_150abb96a3_o.jpg","title":"Noel and I","license":"0","description":"My sister and I at our parent's wedding","rotation":0,"owner":"10301791@N03","ownerName":"starchild459","height":"480","width":"640","dateTaken":"2007-07-20 19:03:45","dateUpload":"954030441","dateCreate":"2007-07-20 19:01:07"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1417/1147457931_bc966b05eb_o.jpg","title":"Home alone","license":"0","description":"A little staying at home alone while parents out for works","rotation":0,"owner":"11598081@N02","ownerName":"dwhansen9","height":"409","width":"593","dateTaken":"2007-08-17 04:48:06","dateUpload":"957883900","dateCreate":"2007-08-17 00:48:28"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1282/1335484389_7d95f9338c_o.jpg","title":"Michael and his parents","license":"0","description":"Walking down the aisle","rotation":0,"owner":"44388541@N00","ownerName":"squiggle.","height":"378","width":"355","dateTaken":"2000-05-01 00:00:00","dateUpload":"960102094"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1397/1047113852_0dd109b59a_o.jpg","title":"Proud parents backstage","license":"0","description":"after Jazz concert.","rotation":0,"owner":"10539009@N08","ownerName":"dygolf71","height":"470","width":"680","dateTaken":"2007-08-07 21:26:30","dateUpload":"961378750","dateCreate":"2007-07-25 00:42:51"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1161/1393086116_e69601f688_o.jpg","title":"Carol & Parents","license":"0","description":"April 2000","rotation":0,"owner":"8812059@N06","ownerName":"CarbonC","height":"397","width":"614","dateTaken":"2007-09-17 03:56:29","dateUpload":"963684808","dateCreate":"2007-06-09 23:47:48"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1264/597619917_83f4f25947.jpg","title":"Grandaddy's parents, brother, & sister","license":"0","description":"&amp; (sister?)","rotation":0,"owner":"75456534@N00","ownerName":"angel/a","height":"391","width":"456","dateTaken":"2007-06-23 01:42:16","dateUpload":"964727231","dateCreate":"2006-11-18 19:15:01"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1038/1378642814_d20e269d0b_o.jpg","title":"Cassidy's parents","license":"0","description":"","rotation":0,"owner":"12731605@N02","ownerName":"MMajestic","height":"270","width":"360","dateTaken":"2007-09-14 03:25:03","dateUpload":"969236269","dateCreate":"2007-09-05 15:53:31"},{"url":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1086/1198454103_b275ae5fdc_o.jpg","title":"Maria and her parents","license":"0","description":"","rotation":0,"owner":"97661716@N00","ownerName":"MariaSaltz","height":"258","width":"369","dateTaken":"2007-08-21 19:04:53","dateUpload":"970877382","dateCreate":"2005-12-28 15:03:59"},
