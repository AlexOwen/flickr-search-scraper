This is a quick script to capture a JSON file of all search results for a given search term, along with the best version of each image in the search.

The JSON file contains as much meta data as I can get from the raw API, more can be got by calling the API for each photo (rather than each page of results), but that would put a lot of stress on the server and might get your key/IP banned.

Images are saved to ./images/

The script is used by typing `npm run start "search_term" "api_key" "start_page"`

An API key can be obtained without logging in by opening the Network tab in Chrome dev tools, running a search on Flickr, then finding the request to api.flickr.com/rest and the parameter in that request called api_key.

The resulting JSON file needs to have a [ added at the start and ] at the end manually.

parents.json is a sample output.

NOTE: This is largely untested, and I can't guarantee Flickr won't rate limit/ban you. It also probably violates their terms of service.
